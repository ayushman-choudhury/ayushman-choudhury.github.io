Write TEST your biography here. Tell the world about yourself. Link to your favorite [subreddit](http://reddit.com). You can put a picture in, too. The code is already in, just name your picture `prof_pic.jpg` and put it in the `img/` folder.

Put your address / P.O. box / other info right below your picture. You can also disable any of these elements by editing `profile` property of the YAML header of your `_pages/about.md`. Edit `_bibliography/papers.bib` and Jekyll will render your [publications page](/al-folio/publications/) automatically.

Link to your social media connections, too. This theme is set up to use [Font Awesome icons](https://fontawesome.com/) and [Academicons](https://jpswalsh.github.io/academicons/), like the ones below. Add your Facebook, Twitter, LinkedIn, Google Scholar, or just disable all of them.

Hello! My name is Ayushman Choudhury. I'm a rising senior at Brown University (Class of 2025), studying Applied Mathematics - Computer Science and Music. 

I've begun to find myself at home with Python, R, and MATLAB, but I have prior experience in Java, C/C++, SQL, and Angular (HTML/CSS/TypeScript). On the math front, highlights of my studies include Computational Statistics, Numerical Optimization, Ordinary and Partial Differential Equations, Computational Linear Algebra and Real Analysis. My long-term goal is to apply my love of mathematical puzzles, aided by modern computational power, to help communities and society at large.

I'm currently a summer researcher at Washington University in St. Louis in the Biomedical Informatics and Data Science program, working with Professor [Linying Zhang](https://linyingzhang.com/) to study applications of Causal Inference to clinical informatics. Going into my senior year at Brown University, I'll be conducting research with Professor [Mara Freilich](https://mara-freilich.github.io/) for my senior thesis on the dynamics of the Southern Ocean. I've also been accepted to be a Data Science Fellow with Brown's relatively new and growing [Data Science Institute](https://dsi.brown.edu/).
